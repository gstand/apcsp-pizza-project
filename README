Pizza Ordering Program - AP Computer Science Principles
Written by Garret Stand
Licensed under the MIT license for academic use.

Prerequisites for running locally:

Python 3 (developed targeting Python 3.10)
The entire directory structure unmodified
fpdf and argparse libraries

Simply run from main.py, all other python files are libraries and will not run.
Order database is present in data/order.json and configuration data for the program is present at data/config.json. All files have a equivalent file suffixed with "example" that contains known good example values. You may also reset these files using the integrated debug menu.

Run the program with -h for invocation and argument examples.

Enjoy :)
